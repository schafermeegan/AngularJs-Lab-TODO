Build Speciﬁcations:  

1. Every Angular component must be in a separate script ﬁle.  
2. Must include a module called “ todoApp ”.  
3. Must include a controller called “ TodoController .”  
4. The controller must add an array of sample todo objects to the view model. Each todo  object has “task” (string) and “completed” (boolean). Include a mix of complete and  incomplete items.  
5. The  ngRepeat  directive must be used.  
6. The  ngClass  directive must be used to add a “completed” class for completed todos. 
 7. The  ngIf  directive must be used to remove the button “complete” button for  completed todos.  
 8. “x” buttons, “complete” buttons, the two inputs, and the “Add” button are all  non-functional for now. Add them to the HTML and style them. We will make them work  in the next lab.

1. ng-repeat
2. ng-class (strike through)
3. complete buttons - ng-if

form would have ng-submit for the add button to add to the list afer they type in "your to do"

ng-submit =" " addToDo(data)

ng-click when you hit complete
ng-delete when you hit the X
ng-filter for the "filter your to-dos
